# CDMSDetection

## Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prevalent, chronic, and progressive disease that affects people worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis of MS are essential for timely intervention and management, which can positively impact disease progression and patient outcomes. Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is a crucial precursor to MS and represents the initial acute clinical manifestation. This project aims to identify and understand CIS as a predictive factor for the subsequent development of clinical definite multiple sclerosis syndrome (CDMS). 

## Dataset
The project uses the multiple sclerosis dataset acquired from the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery (NINN) in Mexico City. 
The dataset is Freely available on [Mendley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8wk5hjx7x2/1) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/desalegngeb/conversion-predictors-of-cis-to-multiple-sclerosis)
